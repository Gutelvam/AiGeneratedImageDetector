# Fake Image Detection using Deep Learning

## 1. Background
The proliferation of artificial image generation technologies necessitates robust methods for detecting synthetic images to combat misinformation and fraud. This project aims to develop deep learning models for this crucial task.

## 2. Objectives
- Develop deep learning models (CNNs and ViTs) for fake image detection.
- Compare the performance of CNNs and ViTs.
- Create an end-to-end pipeline for image authenticity evaluation.
- Apply interpretability techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM).

## 3. Methodology Overview
The project will involve data acquisition and processing, model development (CNNs and ViTs), optimization, and evaluation.
